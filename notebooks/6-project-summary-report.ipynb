    "This project involved building a robust fraud detection system starting from raw transactional data. We performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), engineered domain-specific features, and evaluated multiple machine learning models. The final selection, a **Tuned Random Forest**, achieved an **AUC-PR of 0.6470**, providing a highly effective balance between fraud detection and minimizing customer friction."
